## Quick Start

1. Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"**
2. Add your `PAT_TOKEN` as a secret in your repository settings for GitHub Actions
3. Update the workflow file in `.github/workflows/request-build.yml` to set your repository name
4. Edit files in `yablocks/` to customize your content
5. Add your assets to `public/`
6. Push to `main` branch to trigger deployment

## Workflow Configuration

There is two things to configure in the GitHub Actions workflow file located at `.github/workflows/request-build.yml`:

1. **Repository Name**: Update the `repository` field in the workflow file to point to your repository.
2. **Client Payload**: Update the `client-payload` field to match your repository name.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to set the `PAT_TOKEN` secret in your repository settings. This token is required for the workflow to trigger builds in the YACMS central repository.

The fine-grained token should have at least the following permissions set :

- Read access to metadata
- Read and Write access to code

## Folders Structure

| Folder      | Description                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `yablocks/` | Page configurations and block content (JSON files) |
| `public/`   | Static assets (images, favicon, CNAME, .nojekyll)  |

Both folders are required for the YACMS to work as they will be scaffolded into the final website during the build process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `.nojekyll` file must be present in `public/` for GitHub Pages deployment to work correctly.

CNAME file is optional and should contain your custom domain if you are using one. It is placed in the `public/` folder to be included in the final build.

> [!NOTE]
> The CNAME **must** be place at the root of the `public/` folder to be recognized by GitHub Pages.
> Because the build process scaffolds the `public/` folder into the root of the final website.

## SEO Configuration

The `robots.txt` file in the `public/` folder is used to manage how search engines crawl and index your site. Customize it as needed to improve your site's SEO.

> [!TIP]
> YACMS automatically generates a sitemap for your site, which is essential for SEO.

## Pre-commit Hook

A pre-commit hook is set up to automatically generate a `yablocks.zip` archive on each commit. This ensures the yablocks directory is always packaged and available.

The hook script (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Generate zip of yablocks directory
echo "Generating yablocks.zip..."
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"

# Create the zip file (excluding any existing zip files in yablocks)
zip -r yablocks.zip yablocks/ -x "*.zip"

# Add the zip file to the commit
git add yablocks.zip

echo "✓ yablocks.zip generated and staged"
```

The hook runs automatically before each commit, generating and staging the zip file.
